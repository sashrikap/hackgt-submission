# RetroList

## Project Idea
An antiques and knickknacks marketplace for retro folks!

## Purpose
Find your community of antique and knickknack loving students at your university! This website provides an easy way to see what retro items near you are available, or to sell your own pieces to other students who are looking. The best part is that this would be a university student specific furniture marketplace!

## Usage
1. Create two databases in mongo: ```userinfo``` and ```posts``` using ```createdb```.
2. Navigate to the ```backend``` folder and run ```node server.js```.
3. Create a new terminal and navigate to the ```frontend/furniture``` folder. Run ``` npm i``` and then ```npm start```.
